Weather::Astro7Timer - Simple client for the 7Timer.info Weather Forecast service

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $w7t = Weather::Astro7Timer->new();

  # Get ASTRO weather for the Stonehenge area

  my %report = $w7t->get(
      product => 'astro',    # Forecast type (astro, civil, civillight, meteo)
      lat     => 51.2,       # Latitude
      lon     => -1.8,       # Longitude
  );

  # Dumping the result would give you:
  %report = {

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Weather::Astro7Timer provides basic access to the L<7Timer.info|https://7Timer.info>
Weather Forecast API.
7Timer is a service based on NOAA's GFS and provides various types of forecast products.
It is mostly known for its ASTRO product intended for astronomers and stargazers, as
it provides an astronomical seeing and transparency forecast.

Pease see the L<official API documentation|https://www.7timer.info/doc.php> and
L<GitHub Wiki|https://github.com/Yeqzids/7timer-issues/wiki/Wiki> for details.

The module was made to serve the apps L<Xasteria|https://astro.ecuadors.net/xasteria/> and
L<Polar Scope Align|https://astro.ecuadors.net/polar-scope-align/>, but if your service
requires some extra functionality, feel free to contact the author about it.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 C<new>

    my $w7t = Weather::Astro7Timer->new(
        scheme  => $http_scheme?,
        timeout => $timeout_sec?,
        agent   => $user_agent_string?,
        ua      => $lwp_ua?,
    );
  
Optional parameters:

=over 4

=item * C<scheme> : You can specify C<http>. Default: C<https>.

=item * C<timeout> : Timeout for requests in secs. Default: C<30>.

=item * C<agent> : Customize the user agent string.

=item * C<ua> : Pass your own L<LWP::UserAgent> to customise further.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<get>

    my $report = $w7t->get(
        product => $product,   # Forecast type (astro, civil, civillight, meteo, two)
        lat     => $lat,       # Latitude
        lon     => $lon,       # Longitude
        output  => $format?,   # Output format (default json)
        unit    => $unit?,     # Units (default metric)
        lang    => $language?, # Language (default en)
        tzshift => $tz_shift?, # Timezone shift from UTC (hours, default 0)
        ac      => $alt_cor?,  # Altitude correction (default 0)
    );

    my %report = $w7t->get( ... );


Fetches a forecast report for the requested for the requested location.
Returns a string containing the JSON or XML data, except in array context, in which case,
as a convenience, it will use L<JSON> or L<XML::Simple> to decode it directly to a Perl hash
(in the case of C<png> output, the hash will containg a single key C<data> with the png data).
For an explanation to the returned data, refer to the L<official API documentation|http://www.7timer.info/doc.php>.

If the request is not successful, it will C<die> throwing the C<< HTTP::Response->status_line >>.

Required parameters:

=over 4
 
=item * C<lat> : Latitude (-90 to 90). South is negative.

=item * C<lon> : Longitude (-180 to 180). West is negative.

=item * C<product> : Choose from the available forecast products:

=over 4

=item * C<astro> : ASTRO 3-day forecast for astronomy/stargazing with 3h step (includes astronomical seeing, transparency).

=item * C<civil> : CIVIL 8-day forecast that provides a weather type enum (see docs for equivalent icons) with 3h step.

=item * C<civillight> : CIVIL Light simplified per-day forecast for next week.

=item * C<meteo> : A detailed meteorogical forecast including relative humidity and wind profile from 950hPa to 200hPa.

=item * C<two> : A two week overview forecast (may be unmaintained).

Optional parameters (see the API documentation for further details):

=over 4

=item * C<lang> : Supports C<zh-CN> or C<zh-TW>, otherwise default is C<en>.

=item * C<unit> : C<metric> (default) or C<british> units.

=item * C<output> : Output format, supports C<json> (default), C<xml> or C<png>.

=item * C<tzshift> : Timezone offset in hours (-23 to 23).

=item * C<ac> : Altitude correction (e.g. temp) for high peaks. Default C<0>, accepts
C<2> or C<7> (in km). Only for C<astro> product.

=head2 C<get_response>

    my $response = $w7t->get_response(
        lat     => $lat,
        lon     => $lon,
        product => $product
        %args?
    );

Same as C<get> except it returns the full L<HTTP::Response> from the API (so you
can handle bad requests yourself).


=head1 CONVENIENCE FUNCTIONS

=head2 C<products>

    my @products = Weather::Astro7Timer::products();

Returns the supported forecast products.
